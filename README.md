# Graph_Generator

## This program provides information about a graph, based on the vertices and edges that a user enters. It then generates a Graph or Digraph, based on user selection. The user can then further analyze the graph by choosing from the following options:

1. Find adjacent vertices
1. Find a cycle for a given vertex
1. Find the edge, given a pair of vertices
1. Draw the graph as a Graph or Diagraph
1. Print an adjacency matrix
1. Print an adjacency matrix with path of length 2 (more path lengths still to be implemented)
1. Find all paths of a given length between 2 vertices
1. Print a visual representation of the graph matrix
1. Find all paths between 2 given vertices
1. Print statistics about the graph
1. Find vertices of a given edge
1. Create a graph based on a given matrix (to be implemented later)
